          About EcoGUARD Initiative Uganda
        </h2>
        <p class="text-black mt-2">
          EcoGUARD Initiative Uganda is a youth-led environmental movement
          founded by passionate engineering students committed to protecting
          nature and building a sustainable future. We believe that the health
          of our environment is directly linked to the well-being of our
          communities and future generations. By combining science,
          technology, and grassroots action, we address critical challenges
          such as climate change, deforestation, waste pollution, water
          scarcity, and poor sanitation across Uganda. Through innovative
          engineering solutions, community engagement, and environmental
          education, we empower young people and local communities to become
          active stewards of the environment. Our work ranges from tree
          planting and clean-up campaigns to renewable energy projects,
          eco-innovation labs, and green entrepreneurship programs. Together
          with partners and volunteers, we are creating long-lasting
          environmental impact while inspiring a new generation to lead
          Uganda’s green transformation.
